	<h2>Leitz Family Owned Est. 1948</h2>

	<p>
		John Leitz initiated the beginnings of the photography business with his wife out of their one bedroom home in Skokie, Illinois, photographing clients in their homes
		and outdoors with minimal equiptment. They maintained a small and loyal group of customers that started to grow year by year as customers passed along a good word and
		John put out ads in the local newspaper. By 1954 the Leitzs' had so many people asking them about photographs that they decided to purchase a brick and mortar location
		to meet the growing needs of the business. Here, various photography rooms with themes were set up for a special photography experience. Clients still had the option of
		getting photographed outdoors or in secondary locations. The brick and mortar location was a huge success and brought even more business to the Leitz family. John and
		his wife Helen passed the business down to their son James and his wife Cathy. James and Cathy still run the business to this day with the help of their adult children
		- John Jr. and Maddy. Since the business has been passed down we have purchased another office space to meet our growing clientele. Flashing Lights Photography is and
		always will be a family oriented business that is passionate about snapping unforgetable memories for clients in a fun and friendly manner. Here at Flashing Lights we have
		a strong bond with our clients and do the best we can to accomodate everyone that walks in our doors.
