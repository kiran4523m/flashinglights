	<p>
		Here at Flashing Lights we strive to give customers the best photography experience possibe.
		We strongly suggest reading both our policies and disclaimers before booking, thank you!
	</p>

	<p>
		- We strongly support DEI and will not tolerate any kind of discrimination from staff or clients
		alike. We accept all clients no matter their race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, or any other status.
	</p>

	<p>
		- Every photo session will require a $50 deposit once the date and time have been set. This deposit is
		non-refundable, as cancellations can be costly for us. If you need to change or cancel your photo
		session please try to give us at least 24 hour notice. We would really appreciate it!
	</p>

	<p>
		- During photoshoots we please ask that you don't bring company unless you have small children that
		may need to be cared for. Bringing guests can slow down the progress of the photoshoot so we ask that
		you don't bring any unless absolutely necessary.
	</p>

	<p>
		- Depending on the schedule of the photographer, they may be able to shoot for longer than the scheduled
		session time. If this is the case, there will be an extra $50 added for every half hour extra that the
		photographer shoots.
	</p>
	<p>
		- Lastly, we do not tolerate any bullying of our staff or hate speech of any kind. If you are displaying
		aggressive behavior in the studio or while at a photoshoot we will ask you to leave immediately and potentially
		get law enforcement involved if necessary.
	</p>
